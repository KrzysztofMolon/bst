# bst

bst (pronounced "bestie") is a one-stop shop for running programs
in isolated Linux environments. It is, effectively, a combination
of `unshare`, `mount`, `setarch`, `chroot`, and many others; taking
care of all the low-level minut√¶ to get in an environment that is
as isolated as possible.

The main purpose of bst is running CI/build processes in a somewhat
deterministic fashion.

# usage
