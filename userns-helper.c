/* populate_id_map generates the contents of a [ug]id map.

   First, a mapping of `id` to 0 (root) is generated.

   Then, the function reads each entry in subid_path, which are of the form
   <name_or_id>:<start>:<length>\n, finds any of these allocated [ug]id ranges
   for which name_or_id matches either `name` or `id`, and grafts them
   together as a continuous [ug]id map. The function tries to map every uid
   from 0 to 65534 in the user namespace. If there are less IDs allocated in
   subid_path, the function fills up the available IDs starting from 0, then
   prints a warning and returns.

   The [ug]id map is written to `map`, which is a string bounded by `size`,
   and which follows the format described in man 7 user_namespaces,
   ยง "User and group ID mappings: uid_map and gid_map".

   For instance, given the following /etc/subuid:

       $ cat /etc/subuid
       barney:100000:65535

   Then, calling the function as such:

       populate_id_map(map, sizeof (map), "/etc/subuid", "1000", "barney");

   will populate the contents of `map` with the following data:

       0 1000 1
       1 100000 65534

   There is a special case for id 0 (root) if there are no allocated entries
   for it in subid_path. In that case, if the real uid of the program is 0,
   then populate_id_map maps 1:1 the host range 0-65534 into the user
   namespace. This is to provide a sane default while keeping some leeway for
   system configuration. */
